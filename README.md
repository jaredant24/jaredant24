### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**jaredant24/jaredant24** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- Hi, Iâ€™m Jared Antonio
- Iâ€™m interested in Power Systems
- Iâ€™m currently learning Object Oriented Programming, Signals & Systems, Microelectronics, and EE Probability and Statistics
- I'm originally from Sunnyvale, California 
- I'm a Junior in Electrical Engineering
- I chose my major because I wanted to directly help people through enigneering
- A fun fact about me is:  I became an ordained minister online and have officiated one wedding.
- What do I want to learn from EE 205?  To build my confidence and my intuition in programming
- A book or movie I'd recommend is:  The Secret Life of Walter Mitty
